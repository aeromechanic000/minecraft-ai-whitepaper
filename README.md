Minecraft AI is an open-ended research and development initiative dedicated to exploring how large language models (LLMs), symbolic reasoning, and embodied learning mechanisms can be combined to create
intelligent AI characters (AICs) within interactive 3D environments. At the core of this initiative is the
belief that AI agents in virtual worlds like Minecraft should not only solve tasksâ€”they should evolve into beslievable, collaborative, and socially integrated companions that can play alongside humans. The Minecraft
AI effort is twofold: an open-source project ecosystem for embodied agent development, and a vibrant
community hub for advancing in gaming.

## Whitepapers

[Minecraft AI Whitepaper: Toward Embodied Turing Test through AI Characters](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai-whitepaper/blob/main/whitepapers/minecraft_ai_whitepaper-toward_embodied_turing_test_through_ai_characters.pdf)

## Primary Projects
- [Minecraft AI](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai) : This implementation is extended from the [MINDcraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft) framework and is built on Node.js, utilizing the [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) API. It provides fast deployment, real-time agent control, and flexible plugin supportâ€”making it especially suitable for live demos, interaction-heavy showcases, and rapid experimentation
- [Minecraft AI-Python](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai-python) : This Python-based implementation reimagines the same agent logic in a more research-focused environment. It prioritizes system robustness, fine-grained control, and compatibility with
the Python scientific and AI tooling ecosystem. It is particularly well-suited for educational use, long-term
behavioral analysis, and the development of memory-rich agents
